# Project ledger

Current state and evidence. Removed studies are recoverable at
`archive/pre-subtraction-2026-10`; implementation history lives in Git.

## State (2026-10-08)

The aim is general autonomous discovery and agent improvement. This Python
bank is the first bounded experiment. Settlement owns execution, budgets,
receipts and artifacts. The editable genome contains Codex instructions,
skills, allowed harness settings and the improver's own instructions.

| Checkpoint | State |
|---|---|
| T1 route | User-approved local free-model route through Codex CLI. |
| T3 genome | Content identity, lineage and restricted settings; meta instructions remain editable. |
| T4 episodes | Broker admission, process limits, skill-isolation preflight, token accounting and trajectory records. |
| T5 bank | Published tasks, fixed splits, frozen evaluators, pristine verification and solution snapshots. |
| T10 subtraction | Nine study modules and their callers/tests retired; 49 dead tables dropped by a forward migration. Operator pages inspect genomes, episodes and verdicts. |
| T6 archive | Every genome remains selectable; fixed sigmoid/children selection records scores, coverage, weights and draw. The latest unknown outcome cannot retain an older passing score. |
| T7 proposals | AI proposes a child using editable meta instructions and pinned dev-only evidence. Invalid outputs and execution failures remain recorded. |
| T8 gate | Frozen scope, model and budgets; validation, solved-task regression and fresh paired anchor comparison. Benchmark gains are experimental; trusted mode requires containment. |
| T9 loop | Bounded, replayable archive exploration and an operator CLI. Live task executions complete on a second free route; the improver encountered a provider protocol rejection. No child or acceptance claim. |
| T11 synthesis | AI proposes tasks from observed dev failures. The fixed qualifier requires a passing reference and failing stub before dev publication. Pinned outputs survive interrupted verification. |
| T12 delivery | Checkpoint commits and operator docs; local gates below. [CI status](https://github.com/RoyCoding8/Stray-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml) is tracked per pushed commit. |

## Evidence

Reviewer checkpoint, 2026-10-08: all seven CI jobs passed on the delivered
a3094099 revision, run 37730286147. Read-only inspection of live store rsi_t5
found two completed episodes with failed test verdicts, three timed-out episodes,
one failed and one timed-out proposal, one root genome and zero anchor exposures.
There is still no live child or improvement result.

Two review defects were reproduced and repaired. Archive exploration compared
a child only with its selected parent, so a gain over a weak node could replace
an equally good incumbent. The loop now compares against its current incumbent;
archive parent selection still controls proposal generation. Missing or invalid
completed-turn usage became zero tokens. It now stays unknown and charges the
reservation ceiling, with replay proving no second send or charge.
The six initial regressions failed before repair. The final affected gate passed
32 tests with no skips on disposable PostgreSQL 18.0 databases and real fixture
children; both databases were dropped. No new model calls ran. Follow-up full CI
is separate from the delivered revision's green CI. Ruff was unavailable locally;
changed Python files parsed and git diff --check passed.

The local workspace now has one branch and one registered checkout. Nine stale
remote branch snapshots were tagged on both remotes before deletion, and a
verified all-ref bundle is under D:/AI/Agent-Society-archives/2026-10-08.
Origin's legacy default branch remains for clone compatibility. The current
worker prompt and refinement roadmap supersede the old JSON/EC02 assignments.

The frozen Exercism bank has 34 tasks: 18 dev, 5 val and 11 anchor. All 34
references passed and all 34 stubs failed in actual verifier processes,
without model calls. Bank digest:
`fe81ef1f56941acf910ca7f1ee9a53ac168bfc05e985938d1e70fffe972f5f43`.
See [bank evidence](evidence/rsi-t5/bank-report.json).

The real native runs used `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` on the
approved local gateway. Three task episodes timed out; one improver attempt
also timed out. There were no scored task outcomes, child genomes, gates or
anchor exposures. No model-led improvement or curriculum growth is proved.
Consumed tokens on these failures are ceiling charges, not measured model
usage. See [live evidence](evidence/rsi-t9/report.json). Recovery artifacts
remain in DB `rsi_t5` on port 55432 and `D:/AI/tools/rsi-t5`.

The follow-up authenticated `localhost:4000/v1/models` check returned HTTP 200.
Two Proverb executions using `cohere/north-mini-code:free` completed in 79.2
and 200 seconds. Both failed pristine tests. The bounded loop's improver then
received HTTP 400 because the provider rejected malformed tool arguments in
conversation history. No child, gate or anchor exposure followed. The original
receipt remains `failed`; the corrected parser classifies its actual trajectory
as `infra_failed` and meta results now retain the provider reason. See the
[route diagnosis](evidence/rsi-t9/route-check.json) and
[loop report](evidence/rsi-t9/cohere-loop.json). Gateway availability and completed
execution are proved; task competence and model-led improvement remain unproved.
The provider-classification and meta-reason changes passed 19 focused
PostgreSQL tests across episodes, proposals, loop and synthesis. Replaying the
live loop retained its report values and the recorded send/exposure counts.

The kept Windows/PostgreSQL suite passed **513 tests, with 20 skips** before
final attribution and timeout-test edits. Archived heavy tests were excluded.
The final loop/synthesis check passed **6 tests**, covering the new timeout
case, separate AI/fixed attribution, and qualification recovery. These are
separate verification scopes. The changed new modules and fixtures passed
Ruff checks. A separate real bank-import test passed for LF-only summary
exports, and a recorded native CLI run replayed without a new send. The shared
artifact-path fix then passed **35 focused tests, with 3 symlink skips** on
Windows. Member paths reject Windows drives and backslashes on every OS.
Final delivery requires matching remotes and green CI on the
pushed commit; see the CI link above and the current continuation handoff.
Executable fixtures test proposal, gate, synthesis and replay behavior;
they do not establish AI learning. A fixture solver ran the full benchmark
gate through actual pristine verifiers and received `experimental_gain`.
Strict mode blocked before model execution.

Proven unsent refusals release their reservations through the existing
never-sent reconciliation transition. They receive no fabricated receipt or
task verdict. Unknown dispatches retain their exposure.

## Boundaries and next experiment

- Stronger sandboxing is deferred at the user's request. Native process-tree
  and resource limits remain; filesystem/network containment is unproved.
  A native probe denied a protected file read but still reached localhost
  PostgreSQL. Trusted promotion therefore remains disabled on these launchers.
- Each anchor content identity can be exposed to only one comparison,
  including interrupted runs. Renaming a task or resetting an epoch cannot
  refund exposure. The paired sign rule and alpha spending are recorded.
  This is conservative fresh-content accounting, not REUSE's reusable
  holdout algorithm or proof of general improvement.
- Timeouts stay unscored. Dev workflow failures can inform an improver;
  infrastructure failures stop the run. Acceptance requires completed agent
  executions and known verifier outcomes at every stage.
- Synthesized tasks receive fixed qualification independently of AI proposal
  attribution. Qualification does not prove that AI-written specifications
  and tests are correct. Held-out content duplicates are rejected; accepted
  tasks can enter a future dev task set without changing a frozen epoch.

Next evidence target: a free-model run that completes dev episodes and
produces a changed child, then a matched-budget gate comparison. The current
recorded stopping condition is timeout, not success. Explore stronger native
or container isolation as a separate future checkpoint. No WSL is required
for the current benchmark.
